    <h4><b>Michigan State</b></h4> 
    <p>Since I can remember I have been a michigan state fan. It migth be because that my dad went their for college or just because of the legendary coaches and athletes that have came through the various programs. I can remember the first time I went to a michigan state basketball game at the origional welsh-ryan arena in Evanston. I was amazed at the level of play that everyone was playing at and just how big the guys were in general. I also remember the first that I went to the university to go watch the football team play. It was the first time I got to experience a college campus and a college atmosphere. Everything was more spread out across the campus and kids road bikes and drove around to get to their classes. When I first entered the stadium I was suprised on just how big it was and it was full to the brim with cheering fans. I loved every aspect of college and the sports teams in general.  </p>
