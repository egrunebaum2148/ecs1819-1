    <h4><b>Basketball</b></h4> 
    <p>When I was growing I was involved in all kinds of sports ranging from soccer, lacrosse, baseball, and swimming. When I was around 8 or 9 I tried playing basketball at a local YMCA league. I was pretty bad at first, but as time went on and I learned all of the valuable skills I got better and better and then I really started to love the game. I started to play for a variety of teams from my school team to a travel team that moved all around the region playing in tournaments. When I found out that I was accepted to Lane I immediatly knew that I wanted to play basketball for them. I started to do the fall workouts and realized that this was going to be a team and a program that was going to elevate my skills. When I went to the tryouts I was overwhelmed with all of the kids that were there, we found out later that there was about 100 kids at the tryout. I was semi-confident that I was going to make the team, but I was a 100% percent sure. At the ends of tryouts we found out who made the team and I was really excited to be joining a hardworking and an overall great team.</p>
