    <h4><b>About Me</b></h4> 
    <p>I was born in a suburb of Chicago, but I have spent my entire life in the city. I started school when I was about 3 or 4 and immediatly liked it. In 4th grade I needed a change and I transferred schools to where the commute wasn't as far and many of my friends also went. In about 6th grade I learned about the selective enrollment process. </p>

    <h4><b>Lane Tech</b></h4> 
    <p>After I learned of the selective enrollment process I knew immedialty that I had to study and prepare for the upcoming tests. When I was looking at schools there was one that stood out to me and that was Lane. Lane seemed like a great place with all different types of cultures and ethnicities. After taking the tests, I waited and waited until the emails were sent out, when I heard that I was accepted to Lane I was extremely excited and nervous because the school is so big. As I look back on it I definitly made the right decision in coming to Lane Tech.</p>

    <h4><b>Basketball</b></h4> 
    <p>Ever since I was little I was always involved in sports ranging from soccer to swimming. When I first started to play basketball I immediatly fell in love with the game. I knew that this was the sport that I wanted to pursue. When I learned of Lane's basketball team and how they have had some amazing players come through I knew I wanted to be apart of the program. </p>
